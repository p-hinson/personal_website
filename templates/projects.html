            <h2>CRISPR Genomic Edit Detection</h2>
            <p>Building off research by <a href="https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-020-07233-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #fff8e7">M. Heath Farris et. al</a>, I designed and developed an ensemble model involving an LSTM Autoencoder and statistical test to detect the presence of CRISPR edits.</p>
            <p>I used python, (tensorflow, keras, numpy, pandas, seaborn), bash scripts, MITRE's High Performance Computing Cloud system, and ggplot2 in R for this research.</p>
            <p>The abstract for the poster can be found on page 1489 in the following link:</p>

            <h2>Liars Dice Agents and Backrooms</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite games to play with friends is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_dice" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #fff8e7">Liar's Dice</a> (a.k.a Perrudo, Dudo). Liar's Dice is a fascinating game involving luck and deception, and I've been obsessed with systems underlying the game. I've done some statistical analysis of the game using R and have coded the following agents in Python to simulate the game: Random Agent (Always chooses randomly), Probabilistic Agent (Always chooses action that maximizes probability) and a Neural Network Agent that acts based on estimating reward for actions using a nerual network.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have also created a Liar's Dice Backrooms webapp(Inspired by <a href="https://dreams-of-an-electric-mind.webflow.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #fff8e7">Infinite Backrooms</a>) where Large Language Models play against each other with a variety of prompted strategies and personalities.</p>
            <p>I am currently working on a website and paper with my analysis - I'll link them here when I have them!</p>
            <p>For now, play Liar's Dice online with your friends on my friend's website <a href="http://www.liars-dice.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #fff8e7">liars-dice.net</a> that I am working to implement my AI's with!</p>

                <h2>Statistical Analysis of the Card Game Rugby</h2>
                <p>I did an analysis of the card game rugby for my Computational Statistics class in Grad School. Rugby is a card game where cards are arranged face down in a diamond and a player goes row by row selecting one card from the row trying to get to the end. If the player flips a face card, they start over.</p>
                <p>The project consists of analysis of Monte Carlo simulations of the game to determine if there is an optimal strategy. The answer is: there is! (sometimes)</p>
                <p>The following link has a powerpoint with the findings:</p>
