                    Hello! I'm Patrick Hinson, a Data Scientist with a background in machine learning/AI, statistical modeling, and large-scale data analysis.
                    After double majoring in Statistics with a concentration in Econometrics and Computer Science from the University of Virginia in 2021, I began my career as a Data Scientist 
                    at the MITRE Corporation. I went on to get my M.S. in Data Science from Johns Hopkins University while working at MITRE and transitioning to working on <a href="https://my.uscis.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my.uscis.gov</a>.
                    Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing, weightlifting, and exploring, whether it be wandering around New York City, traveling abroad (I love mountains!), or diving into my next online rabbit hole. Aside from all things data-related, I am particularly interested in the spaces of biology, artificial intelligence, and their intersection!
                    I try to stay up to date with traditional sports and esports alike. I love to think about the underlying systems that influence the things that I encounter day and how they can be modeled. Please don't hesistate to get in contact!
