                <ul>
                    <p>At MITRE, I worked primarily on Biology research. I lead the end-to-end technical design and implementation of a CRISPR Edit Detection AI Algorithm which I presented at the 2022

                    I leveraged MITRE's high powered cloud computing system to build and maintain biological data pipelines, using a suite of CLI/python/R tools.
                    I developed frontend prototypes using Javascript and Flask (The framework this website uses!) Also, check out the episode of the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/469nwh0FqfA67pN9c9Aq5u?si=2bd5be3d726042ee" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color: #fff8e7">
